Create a grade calculator that computes for the semestral grade of a course.
Students could type their names, the name of the course, then their prelim,
midterm, and final grade.
The program should print the semestral grade in 2 decimal points and should
display the following emojis depending on the situation:
happy - when grade is greater than 70.00
laughing - when grade is exactly 70.00
sad - when grade is below 70.00
'''
happy, lol, sad = "\U0001F600","\U0001F923","\U0001F619"
